\usage{
addTests(study, tests, reset = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{study}{An OmicNavigator study created with \code{\link{createStudy}}}

\item{tests}{The tests from the study. The input object is a list of lists.
Each element of the top-level list is a model. The names should be the
modelIDs. For each modelID, each element of the nested list is a test. The
names should be the testIDs. The value should be a single character string
describing the testID. To share tests across multiple models, use the
modelID "default". Instead of a single character string, you can provide a
list of metadata fields about each test. The field "description" will be
used to derive the tooltip displayed in the app. Furthermore, any fields
that match the column names in the results table (added via
\code{\link{addFeatures}} or \code{\link{addResults}}) will be used to
derive tooltips for those columns.}

\item{reset}{Reset the data prior to adding the new data (default:
\code{FALSE}). The default is to add to or modify any previously added data
(if it exists). Setting \code{reset = TRUE} enables you to remove existing
data you no longer want to include in the study.}
}
\value{
Returns the original \code{onStudy} object passed to the argument
\code{study}, but modified to include the newly added data

  # Alternative: provide additional metadata about each test
  tests <- list(

      test_01 = list(
        description = "Name of first test",
