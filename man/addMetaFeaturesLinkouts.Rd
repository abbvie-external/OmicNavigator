\title{Add linkouts to external resources in the metaFeatures table}
\usage{
addMetaFeaturesLinkouts(study, metaFeaturesLinkouts, reset = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{study}{An OmicNavigator study created with \code{\link{createStudy}}}

\item{metaFeaturesLinkouts}{The URL patterns that describe linkouts to external
resources (see Details below). The input object is a nested named list. The
names of the list correspond to the model names. Each element of the list
is a named list of character vectors. The names of this nested list must
correspond to the column names of the matching metaFeatures table (\code{\link{addMetaFeatures}}). To share
linkouts across multiple models, use the modelID "default".}

\item{reset}{Reset the data prior to adding the new data (default:
\code{FALSE}). The default is to add to or modify any previously added data
(if it exists). Setting \code{reset = TRUE} enables you to remove existing
data you no longer want to include in the study.}
}
\description{
You can provide additional information on the metaFeatures in your study by
providing linkouts to external resources. These will be embedded directly in
the metaFeatures table.
}
\details{
For each linkout, the URL pattern you provide will be concatenated with the
value of that column for each row. As an example, if your metaFeatures table
included a column named \code{"ensembl"} that contained the Ensembl Gene ID
for each feature, you could create a linkout to Ensembl using the following
pattern:

\preformatted{ensembl = "https://ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g="}

As another example, if you had a column named \code{"entrez"} that contained
the Entrez Gene ID  for each feature, you could create a linkout to Entrez
using the following pattern:

\preformatted{entrez = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/"}

Note that you can provide more than one linkout per column.
