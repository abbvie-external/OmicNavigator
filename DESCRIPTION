Title: The OmicNavigator R backend
Description:
  OmicNavigator is a tool for interactive exploration of the results from omics
  experiments to facilitate novel discoveries from high-throughput biology. The
  software includes R functions for the bioinformatician to deposit study
  metadata and the outputs from statistical analyses (e.g. differential
  expression, enrichment). These results are then exported to an interactive
  JavaScript dashboard that can be interrogated on the user’s local machine or
  deployed online to be explored by collaborators. The dashboard includes
  sortable tables, interactive plots including network visualization, and
  fine-grained filtering based on statistical significance.
